# LibCodeGen

## SQBE
The current attempt at reformatting the code base from QBE to something suitable for use in a library format, is [SQBE](https://github.com/LibCodeGen/sqbe).

## QFE
The experimental front-end to go with QBE.

## SQBE-C
A fork of https://github.com/michaelforney/cproc to be modified to use libCodeGen instead of the QBE text parser.
